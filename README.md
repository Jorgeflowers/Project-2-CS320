-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
a.Ensuring functionality and security requires a combination of structured testing, secure coding practices, and validation mechanisms. This project applied unit testing to verify key program functionalities, helping identify and address errors before deployment. Secure coding principles, such as input validation and error handling, were also considered to maintain data integrity and prevent vulnerabilities.

-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
a.Understanding user requirements is essential for building effective software. This project emphasized aligning software functionality with expected user behavior, ensuring usability and reliability. By gathering requirements and implementing testing strategies, I validated that the software met user expectations while maintaining performance and accuracy.

-How do I approach designing software?
a.My approach to software design follows best practices such as modularity, test-driven development (TDD), and maintainability. By structuring the software to allow for automated testing and future scalability, I ensured that the program remained adaptable for future updates. Implementing testing frameworks and writing reusable test cases also contributed to maintaining high software quality.
